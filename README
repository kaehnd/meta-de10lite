This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-de10lite layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.


## TODO
- Find out why uboot jtaguart had to be specified with virtual memory address, since CPU was being probed after the uart, and offset was not automatically applied
- Actually figure out what was going wrong with decompression (it magically works now)
- Try not building DT directly into the kernel
- Try booting a non-fitimage
